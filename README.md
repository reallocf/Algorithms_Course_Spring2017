Algorithms Course Spring 2017
-----------------------------
-----------------------------


## Hey everybody,



This is the repo for the peer taught algorithms course at 42 US. It ran from January to March 2017.

I have posted all lecture notes and all available video links for classes here.

You can also ask questions (or, more likely, correct me) using pull requests.

Or you can slack me at csummers if you'd rather.

Edit: Now that I'm no longer at 42 feel free to reach out to me at csummers@linkedin.com instead. I'd be thrilled if anybody else wanted to use this content as a starting ground for their own 42 algorithms class and I would be happy to give you advice on what I learned in the process.



### Thanks for your interest!



Best,

Charlie Summers
